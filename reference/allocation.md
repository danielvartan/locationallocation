# Compute the maximal coverage location-allocation for continuous problems

`allocation()` is used to allocate facilities in a continuous location
problem. It uses the accumulated cost algorithm to find the optimal
location for the facilities based on the demand, travel time, and
weights for the demand, and target travel time threshold and share of
the demand to be covered.

## Usage

``` r
allocation(
  demand,
  bb_area,
  facilities,
  traveltime = NULL,
  mode = "walk",
  dowscaling_model_type = "lm",
  res_output = 100,
  weights = NULL,
  objectiveminutes = 15,
  objectiveshare = 0.99,
  heur = "max",
  approach = "norm",
  exp_demand = 1,
  exp_weights = 1
)
```

## Arguments

- demand:

  A [`RasterLayer`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/raster/man/raster.html) object
  with the demand layer (e.g. population density).

- bb_area:

  A [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_as_sf.html)
  boundary box object with the area of interest.

- facilities:

  A [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/st_as_sf.html)
  object with the existing facilities.

- traveltime:

  A [`list`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html) with the output of the
  [`traveltime()`](https://giacfalk.github.io/locationallocation/reference/traveltime.md)
  function. If not provided, the function will run the
  [`traveltime()`](https://giacfalk.github.io/locationallocation/reference/traveltime.md)
  function based on the provided parameters.

- mode:

  (optional) A [`character`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/character.html)
  string indicating the mode of transport. Options are `"fastest"` and
  `"walk"` (default = `"walk"`).

  - For `"fastest"`: The friction layer accounts for multiple modes of
    transport, including walking, cycling, driving, and public
    transport, and are based on the Malaria Atlas Project (2019) *Global
    Travel Speed Friction Surface*.

  - For `"walk"`: The friction layer accounts only for walking speeds
    and is based on the Malaria Atlas Project (2015) *Global Walking
    Only Friction Surface*.

- dowscaling_model_type:

  (optional) A [`character`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/character.html)
  string indicating the type of model used for the spatial downscaling
  of the friction layer. Options are `"lm"` (linear model) and `"rf"`
  (random forest) (default: `"lm"`).

- res_output:

  (optional) A positive
  [integerish](https://mllg.github.io/checkmate/reference/checkIntegerish.html)
  number indicating the spatial resolution of the friction raster (and
  of the analysis), in meters. If the resolution is less than `1000`, a
  spatial downscaling approach is used (default: `100`).

- weights:

  (optional) A raster with the weights for the demand (default: `NULL`).

- objectiveminutes:

  (optional) A number indicating the target travel time in minutes used
  to compute the statistics (default: `15`).

- objectiveshare:

  (optional) A number indicating the proportion of the demand to be
  covered (default: `0.99`).

- heur:

  (optional) The heuristic approach to be used. Options are `"max"` and
  `"kd"` (default: `"max"`).

- approach:

  (optional) The approach to be used for the allocation. Options are
  `"norm"` and `"absweights"`. If "norm", the allocation is based on the
  normalized demand raster multiplied by the normalized weights raster.
  If `"absweights"`, the allocation is based on the normalized demand
  raster multiplied by the raw weights raster (default: `"norm"`).

- exp_demand:

  (optional) The exponent for the demand raster. Default is

  1.  A higher value will give less relative weight to areas with higher
      demand - with respect to the weights layer. This is useful in
      cases where the users want to increase the allocation in areas
      with higher values in the weights layer (default: `1`).

- exp_weights:

  (optional) The exponent for the weights raster. Default is

  1.  A higher value will give less relative weight to areas with higher
      weights - with respect to the demand layer. This is useful in
      cases where the users want to increase the allocation in areas
      with higher values in the demand layer (default: `1`).

## Value

A [`list`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/list.html) with the following
elements:

- A [`sf`](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/reference/sf.html) object with
  the newly allocated facilities.

- A [`raster`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/raster/man/raster.html) RasterLayer
  object representing the travel time map with the newly allocated
  facilities.
