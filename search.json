Added file argument friction() traveltime() functions allow loading friction surface disk. Refactored codebase better maintainability. Fixed R-CMD-check issues. Added checkmate defensive programming. Added cli improved command line interface, including progress bars. Added lintr updated code follow tidy tools manifesto, tidyverse design principles, tidyverse style guide. Added spelling spell checking. Added testthat unit testing. Added Contributor Code Conduct v3 incentive contributions. Added CITATION.cff codemeta.json files better citation metadata. Added NEWS.md file track changes package. Added R-CMD-check GitHub Action workflow. Added default values allocation(), allocation_discrete() functions. Added demo data documented exports, changed names : naples_shape, naples_population, naples_fountains, naples_hot_days. Added scale north arrow annotations maps using ggspatial R package. default can disabled setting annotation_scale annotation_north_arrow arguments FALSE. Changed theme ggplot2 plots theme_minimal() customizations. Changed allocation_plot() 0 lower limit color scale. Merged allocation_plot() allocation_plot_discrete() single allocation_plot() function. Changed allocation() allocation_discrete() raise error initial coverage greater equal objectiveshare parameter. Changed traveltime_plot() show travel time contours maximum travel time travel time map. Improved code efficiency performance. Improved documentation examples functions.
